# LLM Website blocker

This plugin lets you configure websites to block your future self from accessing (e.g "facebook.com" because social media makes you anxious).

Then, to access that website anyway, you can try to convince an LLM why this time is different.

## Dev / installation

See the [readme](https://github.com/abhijithvijayan/web-extension-starter/blob/react-typescript/README.md) of this plugin-template used to develop this.
It explains how to make this plugin for development/production for firefox/chrome/edge/opera.
